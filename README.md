# Odyssey-Project-in-Arduino-CLE

This repository contains 9 Arduino scripts, designed for Collaborative Learning Environments.

## Getting Started
To run these Arduino simulations using Tinkercad, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP archive.
2. Go to [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and create or log in to your Tinkercad account.
3. In Tinkercad, choose the "Circuits" section to create a new circuit.
4. Import the relevant Arduino sketch from the 'Sketches' directory into your Tinkercad project.
5. Connect virtual components as specified in the project documentation.
6. Simulate and interact with the Arduino project within Tinkercad's virtual environment.
