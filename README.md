# Odyssey Project in an Arduino-based CLE
Welcome to the Odyssey Project, an Arduino-based Collaborative Learning Environment (CLE) designed to introduce students to the exciting world of Arduino through a series of hands-on sketches inspired by the epic tales of the Odyssey.

## Getting Started
To run these Arduino simulations using Tinkercad, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the desired Arduino sketch (.ino file) from this repository.
2. Go to [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and create or log in to your Tinkercad account.
3. In Tinkercad, choose the "Circuits" section to create a new circuit.
4. Import the downloaded Arduino sketch into your Tinkercad project.
5. Connect virtual components as needed for the project simulation.
6. Simulate and interact with the Arduino project within Tinkercad's virtual environment.
