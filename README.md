# Odyssey Project in an Arduino-based CLE
This project aims to provide a collaborative learning environment centered around Arduino, featuring nine hands-on projects inspired by the epic tales of the Odyssey. These projects offer an engaging and educational experience for beginners, allowing them to explore the world of Arduino while fostering collaboration and creativity. Each project is designed to be run as a simulation using Tinkercad, making it accessible and convenient for learners to get started on their Arduino journey

## Getting Started
To run these Arduino simulations using Tinkercad, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the desired Arduino sketch (.ino file) from this repository.
2. Go to [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and create or log in to your Tinkercad account.
3. In Tinkercad, choose the "Circuits" section to create a new circuit.
4. Import the downloaded Arduino sketch into your Tinkercad project.
5. Connect virtual components as needed for the project simulation.
6. Simulate and interact with the Arduino project within Tinkercad's virtual environment.
